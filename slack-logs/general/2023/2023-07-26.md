It makes sense if publishers manage the page format and so on, but readers usually won't do that and this unnecessarily complicates the UI for these kind of users. So perhaps Vivliostyle viewer could clarify or diversify better its kind of audience ? `@shinyu`|

To be used as a previewer for checking page layout during authoring. Vivliostyle CLI's preview command uses it.<br>2. To be used as an online book viewer. Publishers can use Vivliostyle Viewer on their site to make their books available online.<br>Indeed, it is currently addressed to authors or publishers.<br>For suggestions to improvements to Vivliostyle Viewer or Vivliostyle.js core, I recommend you to open GitHub issues <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle.js/issues>|
