I will put it this way: are you interested to cooperate with me for the creation of a MediaWiki extension to paginate wiki pages using your library ? (I think we have to use the core library and the viewer, but we can discuss more about this). I would like to stress that I've published many extensions for MW and they are quite popular, so it could be also good in order to get a more varied audience for your extension `@shinyu`|
