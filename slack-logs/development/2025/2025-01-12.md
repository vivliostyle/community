As a result of this, we can fix some of the significant issues of the current CLI.<br>> <br>> • Hung of launching headless browser (especially in CI)<br>> • Old Chromium on arm64 linux<br>> <br>> And some features can be added!<br>> <br>> • Firefox & Webkit support (*preview command only for now* due to restriction of Playwright)<br>> • Global caching of the browser files<br><br>However, now most of the issues with Puppeteer have been resolved, and it has some advantages over Playwright, especially:<br><br>• Hypenation support on non-macOS platforms  <br>   • see <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle-cli/issues/551|#551><br>• Firefox support for PDF generation<br><br>The only limitation of Puppeteer, as far as I know, is that it does not support WebKit, but I don't think it is very important for Vivliostyle CLI only for previewing.</blockquote>|
