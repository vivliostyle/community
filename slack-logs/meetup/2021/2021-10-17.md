My main business is a mechanical engineer, and I have little to do with IT or typesetting. Therefore, this time I will be on the stage as a beginner user. In the case of business, I think that the content creator and the paper design will be separated, but in the area of hobbies, the same person will do it. In that case, the content creator is often not familiar with typesetting and programming. I would like to talk from that perspective.<br><br>I have been making artificial languages as a hobby for about 10 years. I will briefly explain this only in the part related to the content.<br><br>I look forward to working with you.|
