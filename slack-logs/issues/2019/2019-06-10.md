It seems changes made between 2019 1.102 and 2019 1.103 added some element that glitches Firefox.<br><br>My current workaround is to use ver. 2019 1.102 and add page number by other PDF editor. If there's any other workarounds that I can use newer version of Vivliostyle, I'd like to know.</blockquote>|
