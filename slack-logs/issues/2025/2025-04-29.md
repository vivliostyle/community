I think I've noticed some issue with Vivliostyle Viewer (or/and CLI?). It seems that the viewer tries to blockingly load MathJax from the remote Cloudflare CDN even if it isn't used, but looks like there are some problems with accessing it from my location with Chromium recently. Thus it just deadlocks until the timeout of CLI comes in and the Chromium gets killed. I do not think that's a very major issue—you can just disable the network at all, or enable proxy,—but still.<br>https://vivliostyle.slack.com/files/UAE8V83GA/F08QUR229A4/screenshot_20250429_182629.png|
