Is this also the work of Chrome? * /<br>    / * column-fill: auto; * /<br>    column-fill: balance;<br>} ```<br>If you set the multi-stage set with body, this problem disappears, but this time `column-span` does not work, and the title, author name, and author photo cannot be laid out like output.pdf.<br><br>Is there something wrong with the CSS specification?<br>I'm sorry that I can only ask such a rudimentary question, but thank you.|
