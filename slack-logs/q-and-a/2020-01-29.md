I found this problem existed since 30 Nov 2016 <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/pull/311|https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/pull/311><br>Examining this change might help.<br><blockquote>• Widths of table columns are kept constant before and after a page/column break.<br>    • Resolves <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/issues/157|#157> (Table (column) width should not change over page breaks)<br>• Cells belonging to a single row are fragmented simultaneously and continue after a page/column break.<br>• Row-spanning cells and column-spanning cells are handled appropriately so that they continue after a page/column break with correct width and height.<br>    • Resolves <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/issues/85|#85> (Table cell with rowspan disappears after page break)<br>• The following issue is also resolved:<br>    • Resolves <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle/issues/279|#279> (Table breaks occur between the colgroup and the first row)<br>• Implementation<br>    • An interface representing a formatting context (`adapt.vtree.FormattingContext`) and one representing a processor controlling layout of the given formatting context (`adapt.layout.LayoutProcessor`) are introduced. Implementation classes for these interfaces are registered via `RESOLVE_FORMATTING_CONTEXT` and `RESOLVE_LAYOUT_PROCESSOR` hooks.<br>    • `vivliostyle.layoututil.PseudoColumn` is introduced, which enables layout of parallel flows nested inside a column, not affecting layout process of the outer column. This is used to do layout of table cells in a single table row.</blockquote>|
