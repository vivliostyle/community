Thank you for such a great tool as Vivliostyle. I have a small question, sorry if it's silly.<br>`target-counter()` seems to work for me only when previewing from Vivliostyle CLI (1st picture); if I just manually open the document through Viewer in any browser, the counters don't show up (2nd picture). Is it as expected? (I wouldn't mind using the CLI, but in turn hyphenation doesn't seem to work there because of the issue with Playwright)<br>https://vivliostyle.slack.com/files/UAE8V83GA/F08QKEE5NSC/image.png<br>https://vivliostyle.slack.com/files/UAE8V83GA/F08PFGRHSH5/image.png|
