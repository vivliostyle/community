So we expects to show up well in Vivliostyle Viewer that works in any other browser as well as in CLI. If you can provide a small example to reproduce this issue, could you tell us to help you?|

I uploaded these files to GitHub Pages (which serves them with HTTPS) and opened through a local copy of Viewer, and the counters did show up.|
