I work on a commercial software (a web application that is both SaaS and deployed on-premesis) that produces reports among other things, and I am wondering if I can use Vivliostyle without releasing the source code of my own software (I cannot do that.)  I have done some reading about AGPL and there is some confusion, (and some companies like MongoDB have provided add-on promises or clarifications.)<br><br>Is the intent that use of Vivliostyle should not be usable by any applications except for the relatively small number of web applications that also have the AGPL or GPL license?  Thank you.<br><br>(If the intent is to allow non-AGPL programs to be able to use this software, a clause like this to augment the AGPL may help accomplish that: <http://mo.morsi.org/blog/2009/08/13/lesser_affero_gplv3/)>|

That is a relatively complex question. I do not speak for Vivliostyle nor any other license holder. And I'm not a lawyer. To use Vivliostyle in the browser, you'll need an answer from them.<br>However, if you run Vivliostyle apart from the rest of ypur application, as a service on the server inside a headline browser, then that should be considered as a separate software so that the AGPL would not apply to the rest of ypur web app.|
