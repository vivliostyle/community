I will check your PR <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle.js/pull/503>, is this still WIP?<br><br>The first goal of JS-to-TS migration was to make TypeScript version of Vivliostyle.js same quality and functionality as the current JS version, naturally having same problem, bugs, limitations. We can work on such issues from now, on the TypeScript code.<br><blockquote>Hey <https://github.com/MurakamiShinyu|@MurakamiShinyu> . Something like this is what I am thinking about. It seems like we don't really need to serve the resources directory separately. Or is there something I am missing? This is related to <https://github.com/vivliostyle/vivliostyle.js/issues/502|#502><br><br>PS: Do not actually merge this without having looked through it. I have a hard time understanding the syntax so if it's working it's just by pure luck.</blockquote>|

As for the PR - I believe I simply didn't understand Closure well enough to make the change work.|

But it's essentially the same thing I want to achieve - but now with the TS code. I can wait until the code has been reorganized.|
